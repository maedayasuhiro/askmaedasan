### Ingredients:

### Quick Steps:
1. Cut onion and chicken.  
2. In a pan: add water, sake (or white wine), mirin, sugar → bring to boil.  
3. Add onion, cook till soft → add chicken → simmer to let the flavour soak in.  
4. When chicken is fully cooked, add soy sauce at the end to avoid overpowering the broth.  
5. For fluffy eggs per serving, ladle 1 portion into a small frying pan.  
6. Lightly beat eggs (don’t overmix!). Pour half the egg mixture over the simmered chicken and onion, cover for 30 seconds.  
7. Then pour the rest of the egg, cover again for 30–60 seconds more until soft and silky (not fully set).  
8. Slide it over a bowl of hot rice. Garnish with spring onion or shichimi if you like!
